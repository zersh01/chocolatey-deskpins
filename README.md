 DeskPins puts a little icon in the system tray. 
 When you want a window to stay always on top, clicking on the icon turns your cursor 
 into a pin which you simple left click onto a window to attach the pin. 
 Your window will now stay on top of all the rest. You have unlimited pins,
 so you can have multiple windows on top. Multiple pinned windows will act like 
 normal windows in relation to each other, while always staying on top of unpinned windows.
